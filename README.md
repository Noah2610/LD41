# Medieval Melody Mayhem

![Medieval Melody Mayhem Thumbnail][thumbnail]

This is a jam game made in __74 hours__ for [__Ludum Dare 41__][ludum-dare-game]!  

The theme was __Combine 2 Incompatible Genres__.  
Our two genres were __Tower Defense X Rhythm Game__.

---


## Gameplay
You need to protect the __Fort__!  
Enemies will come rushing from both sides, if they reach the castle in the center, they will deal damage to it.  
To protect the fort, you will need to hit the __prompt keys__ displayed above the enemies,  
as they cross one of the lines to the left or the right of the castle.  

There are __two enemy types__:
- __Zombies__  
  These are the regular enemies.  
  They are killable with __a single key press__.  
- __Wizards__  
  These guys are tougher than zombies.  
  They take __two key presses__ to kill and they __deal more damage__.  

As you kill the enemies, you get to listen to some little tunes :)  
_(If you don't miss the enemies, that is)_  

The longer you survive, the more difficult the game becomes;  
enemies start moving and spawning quicker.  

## Controls
Hit the __keys__ shown in the __prompts__ above the enemies,  
as they cross one of the gray lines.  

__Escape__ - __Quit__ the game
